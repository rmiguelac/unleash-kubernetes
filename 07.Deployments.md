# **Deployments**

A Deployment is a kubernetes object that defines a _desired state_ for a ReplicaSet. The Deployment Controller seeks to maintain the desired state by creating, deleting and replacing Pods with new configurations.

**Use Cases:**

* Easily scale an application up or down
* Perform rolling updates to deploy new version of software

### **# Scaling**

**Scaling** is all about dedicate more/less resources for a particular application

Kubernetes deployments are very good at _**horizontal scaling**_, which involves changing the number of containers running an application

we can:
* change the _replicas_ definition in the deployment manifest
* change the number of pods by running ```kubectl scale deploy my-deployment --replicas=X```

### **# Rolling updates**

Rolling updates allow changes to Deployment Pods at a controlled rate, gradually replacing old Pods with new Pods. This allows update without downtime.

**Rollback** goes hand-in-hand with rolling updates. We can rollback to previous version if the upgrade has a problem.

we can run ```kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment nginx=nginx:broken``` to change an image of a pod in a deployment. If this goes bad, we can ```kubectl rollout undo my-deployment```

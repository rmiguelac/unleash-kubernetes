# Application Lifecycle Management

### **# Rolling Updates and Rollbacks in Deployments**

**Revisions** are created when a deployment is created. In the feature, a new rollout is triggered and a new revision is created. This allows to rollback if required.

```kubectl rollout status deployment/mydeploy``` to check the rollout stats.  
```kubectl rollout history deployment/mydeploy``` to check the rollout history.

**Deployment strategies** can be split into two types:
* **Recreate**: Deletes pods in the initial version then creates then in the newer version. This is not the default as it incurs application downtime. In Practise, this scales down the whole deployment to 0, then to the desired state once its upgraded.
* **Rolling Update**: Take down an oldver version and put newer, n pod at a time. _This is the default version_.

```kubectl set image deployment/mydeploy``` to set a different image to the deployment. This will, for example, trigger a new deployment.

Under the hood, the deployment creates a new _ReplicaSet_ that will deploy the new version, at the same time, taking pods down in the old ReplicaSet. In the rollback, this is reversed.

```kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp``` to undo the deployment change.

### **# Configure Applications**

**Configuring Command and Arguments on applications**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu-sleeper
    image: ubuntu-sleeper
    args: ["10"] #This is being given to the sleep command, overwriting the CMD in the Dockerfile
    command: ["sleep"] # This will overwrite the entrypoint
```

**Args** will be the argument for the command  
**Command** will be the command to execute

**Configuring Environment Variables**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu-sleeper
    image: ubuntu-sleeper
    args: ["10"] #This is being given to the sleep command, overwriting the CMD in the Dockerfile
    command: ["sleep"] # This will overwrite the entrypoint
    env:
    - name: APP_COLOR
      value: pink
```

**Configuring Secrets**

**ConfigMaps** are used to pass configurations as key/value pairs.
* Create the CM
* Inject them in the pod

```kubectl create configmap``` or a configmap manifest, for example:

```bash
> kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=blue
```

or

```bash
> kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=thisfile.properties
```

And for secrets

```bash
>  kubectl create secret generic secret-name --from-literal=DB_USER=username
```

or even

```bash
> kubectl create secret generic secret-name --from-literal=DB_USER=username \
                                            --from-literal=DB_PASS=pass
                                            --from-literal=DB_HOST=thishost
```

**OBS**: In a secret manifest, do not use plain-text, it should be base64 encoded!

# Kubernetes Management

## **High Availability**

K8s is designed to provide HA.  
The cluster can be HA as well, which means we need multiple control nodes as well.

For the control plane, we can have more than one serving behind a load balancer. Thus, in this situation, kubelets will interact first with the load balancer, to then get something from the kube-apiserver, for example.

#### **ETCD**

* Stacked ETCD

etcd runs in the same nodes where control planes are, same setup kubeadm does.

* External ETCD

etcd runs in separate nodes, which then I suppose are server through a load balancer.

## **Management Tools**

* **kubectl**: oficial method to interact with the cluster
* **kubeadm**: tool for quickly and easily creating kubernetes clusters
* **minikube**: similar to kubeadm in smaller scale
* **helm**: package management
* **kompose**: help migrate from docker compose to kubernetes
* **kustomize**: config management tool for managing k8s objects.

## **Safely Draining a node**

To drain, we can run```kubectl drain node_name``` or maybe even, if required, ignore daemonSets with ```kubectl drain node_name --ignore-daemonsets```

To tell kubernetes that new pods can be scheduled on the node, we must run:

```kubectl uncordon node_name```

## Upgrade the cluster with kubeadm

drain the node (1 at the time - starting with the control plane)
update the system and install kubeadm=1.20.2-00
kubeadm upgrade plan v1.20.2
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.2
now upgrae the kubelet and kubectl to newest version
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet
uncordon the node

do the same for the worker nodes

## **Backing up and restoring etcd data**

We should take backups from etcd because thisis were all the data of the cluster is stored.  
All kubernetes objects, applications and so on are in etcd.  

To take the etcd backup we can do it with the ```etcdctl``` command.

### **Take Backup**

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINT snapshot save <file_name>
```

stop the etcd service  

```
rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd
```


### **Restore Backup**

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl snapshot restore <file_name> 
```

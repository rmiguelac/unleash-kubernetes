# Kubernetes Management

## **High Availability**

K8s is designed to provide HA.  
The cluster can be HA as well, which means we need multiple control nodes as well.

For the control plane, we can have more than one serving behind a load balancer. Thus, in this situation, kubelets will interact first with the load balancer, to then get something from the kube-apiserver, for example.

#### **ETCD**

* Stacked ETCD

etcd runs in the same nodes where control planes are, same setup kubeadm does.

* External ETCD

etcd runs in separate nodes, which then I suppose are server through a load balancer.

## **Management Tools**

* **kubectl**: oficial method to interact with the cluster
* **kubeadm**: tool for quickly and easily creating kubernetes clusters
* **minikube**: similar to kubeadm in smaller scale
* **helm**: package management
* **kompose**: help migrate from docker compose to kubernetes
* **kustomize**: config management tool for managing k8s objects.

## **Safely Draining a node**

To drain, we can run```kubectl drain node_name``` or maybe even, if required, ignore daemonSets with ```kubectl drain node_name --ignore-daemonsets```

To tell kubernetes that new pods can be scheduled on the node, we must run:

```kubectl uncordon node_name```

# Storage

### CSI (Container Storage Interface)

```CRI``` Container Runtime Interface created to interact with different container runtimes such as docker, cri-o and rkt  
```CNI``` Coontainer Network Interafce was created to interact with network providers such as flannel, weaveworks, cilium...  
```CSI``` Container Storage Interface was created to enable interacting with different storage vendors, such as Dell EMC, Amazon EBS, etc  
  * CSI Is not k8s only usage, other platforms such as Mesos, use it.

### **# Persistent Volumes**

```Persistent Volume``` is a cluster-wide pool of volumes, to be used by users requesting (claiming) storage

PV Manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-vol1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  hostPath:
    path: /data
```

PVC, known as ```Persistent Volume Claim```. Every PVC is bound to a single PV. PVC can use labels to mach to a PV. 

PVC Manifest
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

Once you delete a PVC, PV remains there. What happens to it can be configured. By default, we have ```persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy``` as ```Retain```, which means PV will remain there until deleted by an administrator. We can have instead of ```Retain```, the option ```Delete```, to automatically delete it once its no longer claimed. The last option would be ```Recycled```, which cleans the data and make the PV claimable again.

A pod can claim a PV by defining

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: mypd
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: myclaim
```

### **# Storage Class**

for PV, the disk must exist first. This is called ```Static Provisioning```. For automatic disk provisioning, we use the ```Storage Class```, and it is called Dynamic Provisioning. For that, we must has a StorageClass manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: google-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
```

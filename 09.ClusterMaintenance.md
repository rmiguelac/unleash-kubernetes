# Cluster Maintenane

**Pod eviction timeout**: time between a node being marked as **dead** and pods being scheduled in a another node. Defaults to 5m and can be configured in the controller manager with --pod-eviction-timeout=XmYs

### **# Cluster Upgrade Process**

One thing to notice here is that kubernetes will only support the latest 3 minor releases.  
So it is good pratice to upgrade your cluster if there are components that are to be phased out of support.

Also, please note that the recommendation here is to upgrade one minor version at a time.

Versioning considerations:  
The cluster components can be at different release versions  

* ```kube-apiserver``` is the prime component, none of the other components should be at a higher version.  
* ```controller-manager``` and ```kube-scheduler``` can be at one version lower
* ```kubelet``` and ```kube-proxy``` can be at 2 versions lower.

For example:

* ```kube-apiserver``` at version v1.10
* ```controller-manager``` and ```kube-scheduler``` could be either in v1.9 or v1.10
* ```kubelet``` and ```kube-proxy``` can then be at v1.8, v1.9 or v1.10

For ```kubectl```, it could be same version, one higher or even one lower. In the above example, kubectl could be at versions v1.11, v1.10 or v1.9

To upgrade the cluster:

* First, upgrade the master nodes (this has no impact on the workloads in the worker nodes, we cannot access the cluster with kubectl, though)
* then upgrade the worker nodes, with one of the approaches
    * one at a time (downtime)
    * all at once (no downtime)

* we can try to put nodes in newer version, instead of upgrading old ones.

For that, we need to:

* update the kubeadm tool to the desired version ```apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00```
* ```kubeadm upgrade plan``` (does not upgrade or install ```kubelets```)
* ```kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0``` (after this, ```kubectl get nodes``` will still show older version because the output of the command refers to the ```kubelets```)
* to update the kubelet, run ```apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00```
* ```systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart kubelet```
* then the worker nodes
* ```kubectl drain node01```
* upgrade kubeadm and kubelet packages with the same apt commands above
* ```kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.12.0```
* ```systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart kubelet```
* ```kubectl uncordon node01```


### **# OS Upgrades**

Usually, to upgrade an OS in a node, we would

* ```kubectl drain node01```, maybe using ```--force```, if there are pods out of a replicaSet, also using ```--ignore-daemonsets```. With this, we would be effectively killing the pods gracefully and marking the node as _unschedulable_.
* then we would do whatever is required in this node OS
* after that, to enable pods to be scheduled again we would ```kubectl uncordon node01```.

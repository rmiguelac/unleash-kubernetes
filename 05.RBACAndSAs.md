# RBAC and Service Accounts

Allows what users are allowed to do and access within your cluster.  
For example, you can use RBAC to allow developers to read metadata and logs from Kubernetes pods but not make changes to them.

## **# Roles**

Define permissions in the cluster.

#### **Role**

Defines permissions in a particular namespace. For example, a pod in that namespace. 

#### **ClusterRole**

Cluster-wide permissions. For example, all pods in all namespaces.

## **# Bindings**

Connects a role to a user.

#### **RoleBindings**

Defines which users have which roles (set of permissions) at namespace level.

#### **ClusterRoleBindings**

Defines with users have which roles (set of persmissions) at cluster level.

## **# Service Accounts**

A Service Account is an account used by container processes within Pods to authenticate with the K8s API

We can bind service accounts with ClusterRoles or ClusterRoleBindings to provice access to K8s API functionality

**QUESTION:** How pods define an SA to use?  
**QUESTION:** How can I use SA account for kbuectl?

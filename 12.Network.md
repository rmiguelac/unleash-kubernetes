# Network

### **# Services**

clusterIP - accessible only in the cluster
NodePort - can be accessed from inside and outside the cluster

kubelet watches changes in the cluster through kube-apiserver, then invokes cni to create network/ip for the pod.  
kube-proxy watches changes from kube-apiserver and creates the relevant service in the relevant node.
* services are virtual objects with IP and Ports
* kube-proxy supports userspace, ipvs and iptables (default is iptables)
    * --proxy-mode can be set in kube-proxy to change between those options
    * the ip range can be defined with --service-cluster-ip-range (default is 10.0.0.0/24)

to see network range of the nodes that are part of a cluster:  
```kubectl get nodes -o wide``` and look for internal IP. Then look for the network (ip a) that matches the initial part of the IP (ens3?)

To see the ip address range configured for the **PODS**:  
```kubectl logs weave-net-1290b -c weave | grep ipalloc```

To see the services ip range in the cluster:  
```cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep cluster-ip```

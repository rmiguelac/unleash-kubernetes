# Scheduling and DaemonSets

Scheduling is the process of assigning Pods to nodes so kubeletes can run them.

Scheduler takes into consideration the following:
- Resource requests vs. available node resources
- Various configurations with node labels

### **spec.nodeSelector.my-label**

used in Pods to configure which node(s) it should be scheduled.  
This will tell scheduler that this pod should be scheduled in nodes with this label

### **spec.nodeName**

bypass scheduling and put a Pod directly in that node.o

## **# DaemonSets**

Daemonsets automatically runs a copy of a Pod in each node.  
If new nodes are added to the cluster, a daemonSet will create a pod in that node.  
Scheduling rules > daemonSets. This means that if a pod cannot be scheduled in a node due to label/non-affinity or whatever other reason, daemonSet will be unable to run a pod in that node.  

## **# Labels, Selectors and stuff like that**

In a Pod:

```yaml
...
metadata:
  labels:
    key: value
```

In a ReplicaSet:

```yaml
...
metadata:
  labels:
    rslabel: rslabel-value
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        podlabel: podlabel-value
```

To filter objects using labels:

```bash
$ kubetl get pods -l key1=value,key2=value2
```

#### **Tains and Tolerations**

Pod to node relationship

* **Taint:** Works by marking a label with something that should prevent pods from being scheduled there.  

```bash
$ kubectl taint node node_name key=value:taint-effect
```

for example

```bash
$ kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
```

where taint effect is the behavior of the pod if they would **NOT** tolerate the taint

In a Pod manifest:

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
**OBS:** Those values in the manifest _MUST_ be encoded in double quotes

* **Tolerations:** Even tough nodes can have taints and some pods won't be able to be scheduled there, pods can can also have _tolerations_, meaning that they can tolerate a taint and be scheduled in that node.

**Taint Effects**
* **NoSchdule**: pods will not be scheduler
* **PreferNoSchedule**: system will try to avoid the pod in the node
* **NoExecute**: New pods will not be scheduled in the node, pods in the node will be evicted if they do not tolerate the node

_Tains and tolerations are only meant to restrict nodes from accepting certain pods_, which means that the Pod can still be scheduled in another node, even if it tolerates the taint.
